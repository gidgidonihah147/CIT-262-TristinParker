# CIT 262 TristinParker
 
Greetings everyone! My name is Tristin Parker, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a focus on web design and engineering. I am in my final year here at BYUI and am excited to be finishing up. I have lived in northern Utah my whole life and have never wanted to go elsewhere, although I served a mission in Riverside, California, which was a wonderful time.

I have been married to my amazing wife for 8 years now, and together, we have two wonderful boys aged 5 and 3. They are the light of my life and always keep us on our toes with their endless energy and boundless curiosity.

When I am not spending time with my family or studying, I work as a project manager for a utility company where I have been employed for the past 8 years. In my free time, I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons with a group of close friends. In fact, we have been playing one epic campaign after another for the past 15 years! It is a fantastic way to unwind and take my mind off the demands of life.
